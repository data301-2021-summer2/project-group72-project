## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{The Topic of interest is to determine the distribution of adult salaries within this dataset to see what different main categories that they are distributed in. This would be an interesting comparison to see the most common profession and  marital status between the different distributions. By contrasting the status of individuals and their respective salaries will show the most common outcomes of individuals within different status groups between professions and marital status. 
The dataset compares variables such as age, education, marital status, race, sex, hours per week, and more. This gives us a large amount of status variables to use as a means of comparison. The dataset has a large amount of data entries which will ensure that we have enough data entries per status variable we choose to compare. This allows us to ask a wide variety of questions within the dataset, which we can use throughout the project milestones. }

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{This dataset is comprised of data collected from the "1994 Census Income" dataset , and was donated by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker from the Data Mining and Visualization section of UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset was donated to the association on 19967-05-01 and was extracted from the "Census Income" dataset with the conditions of the individuals being between 16-100 years of age that are working at least 1 hour a week. This dataset has a large amount of variables that can be contrasted to allow us to answer questions such as: Of the people with #### status variable, how does this effect their salaries compared to ###@ status variable? The different attributes given from the dataset are : Age, workclass, fnlwgt, education, education-num, maritial status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, captial-gain, captial loss, hours-per-week, and native-country. This is a very wide dataset, which gives several paths to compare the salaries and status variables with other pairs or multiple sates variables. This dataset was comprised with the intention of "predicting whether income exceeds "#50K/Yr based on the census data.."(Abstract). This gives us a good baseline for comparison.}
